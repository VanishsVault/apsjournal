## Installation

In the setup screen, use the URL `https://github.com/VanishsVault/apsjournal/releases/latest/download/module.json` to install the module.

## Optional Dependencies

- [Monk's Enhanced Journal](https://www.foundryvtt-hub.com/package/monks-enhanced-journal/)

## Usage

After enabling the module, everything is ready to go. I've tried to make it as easy as possible to use the new features.

The new Text Styles can be found under the Style dropdown at the left of the toolbar.

You can find the new Panels and Blocks under the Templates button.
