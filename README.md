Need to draw attention to important information in your journals? Panels have you covered, from informative to notes to warnings and bonuses.
Like the D&D style text? Fake it till you make it with D&D Text Styles you can apply to Headings and body text.
No more boring encounter pages. Liven it up with the Encounter Block, complete with Adversary listing!
Add some panache to your Featured Item listings and describe them complete with item links to a quickly accessible aside.
Have a description to read aloud and need a way to differentiate it on the page? Read Aloud block to the rescue!
Need to keep your dialogue between NPCs straight? Dialogue blocks come in 7 different colors with left and right icons.

## Installation

In the setup screen, use the URL `https://github.com/VanishsVault/apsjournal/releases/latest/download/module.json` to install the module.

## Usage

After enabling the module, everything is ready to go. I've tried to make it as easy as possible to use the new features.

The new Text Styles can be found under the Format dropdown at the left of the toolbar.
You can find the new Panels, Blocks, and Dialogues under the Stylish dropdown.
