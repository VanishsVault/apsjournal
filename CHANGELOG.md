# RELEASE NOTES

## 2.0.0 - The v10 Compatible Release

### ADDED

- Blocks:
  - Scroll Block. Similar to the Card block, but in green with a tattered parchment on top of which you can add an image that will automatically be sized and centered for you.
  - Black, Blue, Green, Orange, Purple, Red, and Yellow Featured Item blocks. You can add an image on top of the highlight circle on the left side and it will be scaled and centered for you, just like you could always do on the Card block.

- Fonts:
  - The same fonts are included as before but use the new custom font system built-in to v10 of Foundry VTT. This will reduce conflicts with other modules. No more hacking the system.
  - Dungeon Drop Case font has been added also from Solbera.

- Sidebar:
  - Users of the APSJ for MEJ module had a nice sidebar styling and theme switcher. That styling has been brought to the native v10 journal system.

### REMOVED

- Blocks:
  - Magic Items. I have instead provided Feautred Item blocks in a multitude of colors to replace the generic magic item block.

### FIXED

- Theme:
  - Fixed the bug that would place munltiple theme switcher buttons on the toolbar.

### NOTES

- This version is NOT backwards compatible. I apologize for the inconvenience. In order to work with v10's new editor and to create a namespace for my styles to avoid conflicting with other modules and systems, this change was a necessary evil. It shouldn't be very hard to copy/paste your existing data into the new blocks, panels, dialogues, etc.
- You may need to go into the settings and re-enable the parchment texture if you had it turned on before and it isn't working now.
- I am humbled by how many users have found the module useful on so many different systems. I originally only planned to support D&D 5e, but I've been trying to keep up with conflicts on other systems as well. Look forward to some upcoming additions for those you of not playing fantasy RPGs.
