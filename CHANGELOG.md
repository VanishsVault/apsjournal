# RELEASE NOTES

## 3.0.0 - The Conjoined Conjuring Release

### ADDED

- APSJ and APSJ4MEJ have been combined into a single package. This will make maintenance and new features easier.
- APSJ users have gained the new Dialogue blocks.- Sci-Fi Fonts and styles . I am humbled that so many people have used my modules in so many systems. I'll try to support you all!

### NOTES

- The version number needs some explaining. Because APSJ was at version 1.6.1, and APSJ4MEJ was at version 2.6.0, I decided to increment the version of the combined module to 3.0.0 to avoid any backwards compatibility issues and troubleshooting nightmares. I apologize for the inconvenience.
- You may need to go into the settings and re-enable the parchment texture if you had it turned on before and it isn't working now.
- I am humbled by how many users have found the module useful on so many different systems. Look forward to some upcoming additions for those you of not playing fantasy RPGs.
